# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:

To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points

## ALGORITHM:

### Step 1: 
Get the list of values from the user.
### Step 2: 
Get the value from the user for the number of points.
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.jpg)
### Step 4: 
Declare a function starting with keyword 'math'.
### Step 5: 
Within the function print the output statement and display the output.
### PROGRAM:
```python
#Program to find the distance between two points.
#Developed by:Preethi.A.A
#RegisterNumber:22008332
import math
l1 = [4,2]
l2 = [10,6]
distance = math.sqrt(((l2[0]-l1[0])**2)+((l2[1]-l1[1])**2))
print("{:.2f}".format(distance))
```
### OUTPUT:
![](./Distance%20between%20two%20points.png)
### RESULT:
Thus the result for finding the distance betwwen two points using python programming is executed.
